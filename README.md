# ATMS-597-Project-4-Wx-Prediction


The goal of this analysis is to (1) Use multiple linear regression to predict a WxChallenge-like forecast using past Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast data. (2) Repeat (1) with random forest regression.

Our task is to use the 12 UTC forecast and observations up to but not including the following 00 UTC to predict the following variables for the period 6 UTC to 6 UTC the following day:

Maximum Temperature (°C)
Minimum Temperature (°C)
Maximum Wind Speed (m/s)
Total precipitation accumulation (mm)


# Dependencies:
Required packages

# Notes from office hours:
-precipitation from KCMI data is in mm
-do not use precipitation from KCMI_daily file
-units for GFS wind are m/s
